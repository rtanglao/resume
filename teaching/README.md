## Goal

To work at the intersection of learning and tech, helping people to use, rather than be used by, computers and technology.

## Summary

I introduced and taught a class in Web Design in 1996 through Ohio University's Continuing Education program. In 1997 I was a monthly guest on WOUB, the univerity radio station, on the Art of Conversation show, where I would explain technical issues in plain language. From 2000 to 2002 I taught Intro to XML and XML Programming in the University of British Columbia's certificate program.

I have mentored for Ladies Learning Code and Mozilla's Software Carpentry. I co-taught (with Amber Frid-Jimenez) The Web as a Medium of Expression, a course we introduced at Emily Carr University to introduce design students to programming, and where we introduced them to HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript and took them through to building interative visualizations pulling down data from the web by the end of the term.

For three terms I have mentored 3-10 students per term with Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects, with the students working on Waterbear, an open source project I lead to make it easier to learn programming. This is an intensive program with weekly reports and meetings, where the students are expected to put in at least 10 hours a week filing and fixing bugs, implementing new features, and working on a larger term project.

I am the co-host and organizer for the Maker Education Salon, a partnership between Vancouver Maker Faire and Mozilla Hive, which brings educators, librarians, parents, community organizers, makers, and kids together on a quarterly basis, with an annual "Pop-Up" event. This helps all the local folks involved in making and education to learn about each other and build connections.

I am currently seeking a new challenge and would love to pass on the lessons I've learned from 20+ years in the tech industry, working for companies large and small. My full technical experience can be found [here](https:https://dethe.github.io/resume/).
