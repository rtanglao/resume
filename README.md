## Summary

- Email me at rolandt@gmail.com if you have a software support role that combines working with folks who use the software, getting insights from these folks and working with engineering and product to improve the software based on those insights. Even better if I can help update the documentation so users benefit from every support ticket and insight!
- I love software and people and have many years of experience supporting software products and developing them. 
- Some examples of products that I would love to work with include (not in order): slack, Tableau, WordPress, github, gitlab, Thunderbird, Squarespace, Lightroom, R Studio and many more!

## Experience

### Firefox Support Analyst & Support Release Manager, Mozilla Corporation

- Vancouver, BC (the rest of the support team was in the USA, Europe and Asia)
- January 2016 - August 2020
 
As support analyst, I improved Mozilla and Firefox products (Firefox for Android; Firefox for Desktop: Windows, Linux, macOS; Firefox Lite; Mozilla VPN; Firefox Reality and more) by collecting and feeding back user insights both manualy and using dashboards to engineering and product. As support release manager, I ensured that support was ready for both new and existing products by coordinating user documentation with our content editor, ensuring our support site was ready by working with support site software developers and designers and working with product management and engineering.

1. For every release, I gathered user insights for Firefox Desktop and Firefox for Android and reported them back to engineering and product management.
1. Onboarded new products such as Mozilla VPN into support: ensured documentation was ready, for free products coordinated with community managers to ensure the volunteer support community was ready, for paid products such as Mozilla VPN worked with support agents to ensure paid support was ready.
1. I wrote [scripts](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-kits-api2) in Ruby and R using R Studio to collect support related data using REST APIs and visualized that data using R's ggplot2 library.
1. I co-project managed a Tableau visualizer engineer and a back end data engineer and was also the end user for four  dashboards (Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android, Support Community Performance, Mozilla VPN dashboard) in Tableau from requirements to deployment. The data was stored in Mozilla's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with the data in Google Big Query (BQ). 

### Firefox for Android & iOS Support Coordinator, Mozilla Corporation

- Vancouver, BC
- November 2012 - January 2016


Gathered insights, coordinated the awesome volunteers, user documentation and the support forum for the fantastic Firefox for Android and iOS user support community on support.mozilla.org (SUMO).

### Mozilla Thunderbird Technical Support Lead, Mozilla Messaging

- Vancouver, BC
- July 2009 - November 2012

Coordinated community support and provided end user support for Mozilla Thunderbird. As the only support person, I was involved in every aspect of support including  documentation, the support website and community management. We used Get Satisfaction for our forum support and in 2012 I received [an award from Get Satisfaction](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2012/02/14/1204183/0/en/Get-Satisfaction-Announces-Annual-Love-Your-Customers-Awards-for-Excellence-in-Social-Customer-Engagement.html) for innovative use of their REST API to collect support metrics and gather insights using [Ruby scripts and MongoDB](https://github.com/rtanglao/momogs/).
