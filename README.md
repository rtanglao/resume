## Summary

- Proven ability to improve software products by analyzing user feedback and reporting insights as well as improving support documentation and processes. Please email me at rolandt@gmail.com if you have a software support role that combines working with folks who use the software, getting insights from these folks and working with engineering and product to improve the software based on those insights. It would also be great if I could help update the documentation so users benefit from every support ticket and insight!
- I love software and people and have many years of experience working at the intersection of software developers and those who use the software. I am an avid life long learner who enjoys becoming an expert in a software product from the API level up, supporting software products and developing them. 
- Some examples of products that I would love to work with include (not in order): slack, Tableau, WordPress, github, gitlab, Thunderbird, Squarespace, Lightroom, R Studio and many more!

## Experience

### Firefox Support Analyst & Support Release Manager, Mozilla Corporation

- Vancouver, BC (the rest of the support team was in the USA, Europe and Asia)
- January 2016 - August 2020
 
As support analyst, I improved Mozilla and Firefox products (Firefox for Android; Firefox for Desktop: Windows, Linux, macOS; Firefox Lite; Mozilla VPN; Firefox Reality and more) by collecting and feeding back user insights both manually and using dashboards to engineering and product. As support release manager, I ensured that support was ready for both new and existing products by coordinating user documentation with our content editor, ensuring our support site was ready by working with support site software developers and designers and working with product management and engineering.

1. For every release, I gathered user insights for Firefox Desktop and Firefox for Android and reported them back to engineering and product management.
1. Onboarded new products such as Mozilla VPN into support: ensured documentation was ready, for free products coordinated with community managers to ensure the volunteer support community was ready, for paid products such as Mozilla VPN worked with support agents to ensure paid support was ready.
1. I wrote [scripts](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-kits-api2) in Ruby and R using R Studio to collect support related data using REST APIs and visualized that data using R's ggplot2 library.
1. I worked with Mozilla's IT team (a Tableau visualizer engineer, project manager and a back end data engineer) to successfully design and deliver  four  dashboards (Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android, Support Community Performance and a  Mozilla VPN dashboard) in Tableau from requirements to deployment. The data was stored in Mozilla's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with the data in Google Big Query (BQ). The dashboards were used by our support community managers, myself  and our stakeholders in product and engineering to get insight to improve the products and our support.
